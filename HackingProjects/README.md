# Hacking Projects  

## How to prepare vulnerable machines?
* Although there are many hacking platforms, such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box, these platforms require a fee to learn penetration testing.  
I select **[VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)** and **[Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3)** platforms because these platforms do not require a monetary investment.
